# NextAuth getServerSideProps Session Always Null in Production

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using NextAuth.js with `getServerSideProps` in a Next.js 15 application.  The issue is that the session object is consistently null in the production environment, despite successful login, while working correctly locally.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up a NextAuth provider (e.g., Google, Email).  Ensure your provider is correctly configured.
4. Run the application locally: `npm run dev`  (The session should work correctly.)
5. Deploy the application to a production environment (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).  (The session will be null.)

## Expected Behavior

The `session` object within `getServerSideProps` should contain the user's session data when logged in, both locally and in production.

## Actual Behavior

The `session` object is always null in the production environment, irrespective of login status.

## Possible Solutions (Investigating)

* **NextAuth Configuration:**  Incorrectly configured provider settings or missing environment variables could be causing this behavior. This is likely, as the issue only happens in production.
* **Deployment Settings:**  Deployment specific configurations or build processes could be interfering with the session management.
* **Caching:** Some form of caching or other deployment optimization might be removing the session data before it reaches `getServerSideProps`
* **Server-Side Rendering:**  There might be an issue relating to how server-side rendering interacts with the NextAuth session data.
