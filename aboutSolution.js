```javascript
// pages/about.js
import { unstable_getServerSession } from 'next-auth';
import { authOptions } from './api/auth/[...nextauth]';

export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const session = await unstable_getServerSession(context, authOptions);
  // Ensure the session is passed correctly
  return {
    props: {
      session: session || null //Explicitly handle null session
    }
  };
}

export default function About({ session }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>About Page</h1>
      {session ? (
        <p>You are logged in! {JSON.stringify(session)}</p> //Inspect Session data 
      ) : (
        <p>You are not logged in!</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Further Debugging Steps:**

1.  **Verify NextAuth Configuration:** Double-check your NextAuth configuration in `pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js` to ensure all settings are correct and that any required environment variables are properly set in your deployment environment.
2.  **Check Server Logs:** Examine the server logs during production deployment to identify any errors or warnings related to NextAuth or session management.
3.  **Simplify the About Page:** Temporarily remove unnecessary code from the `About` page to rule out any conflicts or unintended interactions with the session data.
4.  **Inspect Network Requests:** Use your browser's developer tools to inspect network requests and see if the session data is even being transmitted correctly from the NextAuth API.
5.  **Test with a Different Provider:** Try switching to a different authentication provider (e.g., if using Credentials, try Google or GitHub) to see if the issue is specific to the current provider configuration.
6.  **Try `getServerSideProps` with a different endpoint:** If you have other protected routes, see if the session is correctly handled on those. If it is, it's likely an issue unique to this specific route and perhaps how this page is built or used.
